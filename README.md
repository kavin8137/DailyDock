# Overview

I built this program to design a webpage that I will be using in the future for my school and daily work. (Of course I will set the webpage repository only to myself so that it is personal to me). I built this webpage using HTML and JavaScript along with CSS to enhance the webpage to be pleasible. After my research and get inspiration from multiple tutorials on the features that I wanted to be included in this webpage, I assembled all these features into my page.

The HTML mainly construct the section that where JavaScript will target and implement the code into the page. I have included the title for the page, informing the current day and time and shows the forecast for the city of Rexburg. After that, it is a calendar that can be interacted by the user and putting some tasks to the day. The list will display once is being clicked.

Lastly, I have included a Card Game in case I need a break from my day. I did followed the card game tutorial and build my own code and design of the card using the CSS features. (Shout out to ChatGPT on helping me debugging my code for the design and the flip methods).

The code basically work without any installation, which I could be wrong. At least I did not do any additional installation to my local computer when I was working on this project. **However, if you choose to clone this repository and view it on your local computer, you have to view the html file using Visual Studio Code under the option (mouse right click) of "Open with Live Server".**

Nevertheless, here's the link to the resulting website for demonstration.

I have also include a short demonstration video on explaning how the program works.

# Development Environment

Here is the libraries, languages, tutorial, and packages that I have used to build the program.

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* Forecast Tutorial
* To Do List Tutorial
* Card Game Tutorial

# Useful Websites

Here are the links that I have used to help me build better understanding about both JavaScript and HTML. I have used some help from the tutorial on building the features and assemble them into a single page. I did used some help from ChatGPT on debugging my code since JavaScript will not tell me if there is any existing typo. ChatGPT also give me some idea of Client-side Storage, which I have also listed the reference below.

# Future Work

- The icon on the forecast is not peasable. However, I don't know what more I can do with it at this moment. However, it will be a cool project to work on it in the future to fix the color for the forecast.
- The calendar works perfect along with the to do list embedded in it. However, I did not have options to delete the item if we accidentally adding the item in a wrong day. This will also be a cool project for the future.
- I tried to make the code auto detect the name of the local city based on the coordinates. However, I am still not sure how to do it. Hence, it will be a cool project to work on in the future to replace the header of 3-Day Forecast for Local City to 3-Day Forecst for the City of (name of the city).
